ðŸ“š Library Management System

A simple Library Management System built in C++ using linked lists and stacks to manage book records efficiently. This console-based project allows users to:

ðŸ”¹ Add, Search, Display, and Delete Books in the library ðŸ“–

ðŸ”¹ Issue and Return Books using a stack-based system ðŸ”„

ðŸ”¹ Manage Book Records through an interactive menu

âœ¨ Features:

âœ… Search for books by ID

âœ… Issue books and track issued records

âœ… Return books in LIFO order (Last Issued, First Returned)

âœ… Delete books from the library

âœ… Simple and intuitive command-line interface

This project demonstrates fundamental data structures like linked lists (for book storage) and stacks (for issued books), making it a great learning resource for C++ and DSA concepts.
